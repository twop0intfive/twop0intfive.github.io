title: "April update and DARK MODE!"

...so, I'm still working on the dark mode aspect.

Several months ago stumbled upon Dev.to, and it's been a great resource! (Speaking of, I should add a new footer link...) I read the weekly emails as they seem to have value for my current role. The dark mode idea came from [Ananya Neogi](https://ananyaneogi.com/) post [Create A Dark/Light Mode Switch with CSS Variables](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/create-a-dark-light-mode-switch-with-css-variables-34l8), and I thought it'd be a good way to work through something more complex than a "Hello, World!" while remaining manageable.

It may take me some time to get it working, depending on available time. I'm still working on my Master's and, when combined with the still-relatively-new job and all of the other demands on my time, this tends to take a backseat. However, I'd like to not feel so much like I don't know what I'm doing at work, so I'm going to use this site to learn a little webdev.

We'll see what else comes out of this. Bear with me.

It's been a busy summer so far! 

I completed the first semester of my graduate degree, which accounts for most of the sense if busy-ness over the past few weeks. I also took a much-needed mini-vacation and managed to come back refreshed. 

I'll keep working on this and see what I can make out of this. The blog portion, to be honest, isn't something I'm sure I'll keep at this point in time; it's possible I'll switch to another blog-specific platform for these purposes, but it's just as likely that I'll keep these posts up here. I'm honestly not sure yet; graduate life is busy as it is, family and work commitments nonwithstanding. 

In the meantime, I'll gradually work on having less "Coming soon!" placeholders around here, and maybe add some sort of color or theme.
